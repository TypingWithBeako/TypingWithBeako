## 🤔 Who am I?

Just someone who enjoys building things! I'm currently exploring different programming languages and technologies whenever something interesting catches my eye. No loyalty to any specific language - we're all just telling computers what to do, right?

## 🚀 What have I been up to?

My most notable project so far is probably this obsessively detailed media player for Re:Zero that I spent way too much time on (but regret nothing!). It started as "I just want to watch my anime" and turned into a 6-month journey of "but what if I added JUST ONE MORE feature?"

## 💡 My development philosophy

*   💖 **Unexpected joy**  - I love when people find small delightful details in things I build.
*   👨‍💻 **Learn by doing**  - Tutorials are nice, but I learn best by making something I actually care about.
*   🐇 **Embrace the rabbit hole**  - Sometimes going way too deep on one thing teaches you more than skimming many things.

## 🌱 What's next?

**Currently learning:** <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-automation" target="_blank">Automation with Python</a> (Google's Coursera course) - _April 2025_

I'm always exploring new technologies and skills. My learning journey tends to follow my curiosity rather than a rigid roadmap. 🗺️

_I'll update this section whenever I dive into something new. Check back to see where the journey goes next!_
